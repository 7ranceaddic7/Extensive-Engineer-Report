# Extensive Engineer Report
Extensive Engineer Report is a [Kerbal Space Program](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com) mod that extends the Engineers' Report in the Vehicle Assembly Building and the Spaceplane Hanger with additional checks to ensure that your vessel has everything you need.

## Tests In This Version
* Unmanned With Science And No Transmitters
  * Warns when a vessel has no crew, no stock science transmitters, but it does have science experiments
  * Severity: Warning
  * Suggested by: Someone on [/r/KerbalSpaceProgram](http://reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram) (if you suggested this, let me know and you'll get credit here)
