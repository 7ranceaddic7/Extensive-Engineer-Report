# Extensive Engineer Report
Extensive Engineer Report is a [Kerbal Space Program](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com) mod that extends the Engineers' Report in the Vehicle Assembly Building and the Spaceplane Hanger with additional checks to ensure that your vessel has everything you need.

## Tests In This Version
* Unmanned With Science And No Transmitters
  * Warns when a vessel has no crew, no stock science transmitters, but it does have science experiments
  * Severity: Warning
  * Suggested by: Someone on [/r/KerbalSpaceProgram](http://reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram) (if you suggested this, let me know and you'll get credit here)

## How To Report Bugs and Request Features
If you find a bug or have a feature request, [add an issue here](https://github.com/jkoritzinsky/Extensive-Engineer-Report/issues/new) on GitHub. This will have the fastest turnaround.

### Custom Test Configuration Through UI
Once KSP 1.1 on Unity 5 is released, and no earlier, I will create a configuration UI for this mod.
